# react-line

> Provide a React component to draw a line.

Underneath, it's only using a classic `<div>` that it rotates and positions
where it needs to be.

## Why

Sometimes, you want to draw a line in your page (mostly, a line that is linked to 2 items that can move for instance), not using fancy stuff. A `<div>` is not a fancy stuff but requires some mathematics to handle the position and rotation properly from 2 coordinates.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save react-line
```

## Props

You need to provide 4 coordinates to draw a line which are the props of the
component :

```javascript
static propTypes = {
  from: React.PropTypes.shape({
    x: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    y: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  }),
  to: React.PropTypes.shape({
    x: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    y: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  }),
  style: React.PropTypes.string
}
```

`style` is optional and is the css style you want to apply on the line.
The default is `1px solid black`.

## Usage

```javascript
<Line
  from={{x: 10, y: 20}}
  to={{x: 10, y: 100}}
  style="5px solid orange"
/>
```
